# Modelling the Dynamics of Love
Numerical Methods Project. This notebook creates an algorithm using the Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg Adaptive Step Size Method to solve for Ordinary Differential Equations. In this notebook, the dynamics of love model was solved and presented. All algorithms and sources have been explained in the notebook itself.

ENGG 27.01: Numerical Methods Project using Julia. A good introductory article to Julia can be found here: https://medium.com/swlh/introduction-to-julia-946c242ddac1

Julia can be downloaded here: https://julialang.org/downloads/ and its documentation can be found at this link: https://docs.julialang.org/

Connecting Julia to Jupyter Notebook is as:

1. Install and run Julia. 
2. Use the command `using Pkg` 
3. Use `Pkg.add("IJulia")` after
4. Download Anaconda and run Jupyter Notebook and the Julia environment should be seen when the New command is clicked.
